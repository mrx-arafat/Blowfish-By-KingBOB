# Blowfish Encryption/Decryption in Python

## Introduction

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Blowfish encryption algorithm. Blowfish is a symmetric-key block cipher, notable for its simplicity and speed. It was designed by Bruce Schneier in 1993 as a fast, free alternative to existing encryption algorithms.

The script in this repository encrypts and decrypts text data using the Blowfish algorithm. It converts input strings into an integer format suitable for the algorithm, processes the encryption or decryption, and then converts the results back to string format.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Setup

To use this script, you need to clone this repository or download the Python file directly. No external libraries are required as it uses standard Python libraries only.

You can clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrx-arafat/Blowfish-By-KingBOB.git
```

## Running the Script

To run the script, navigate to the directory containing the script and execute it using Python.

```bash
python blowfish.py
```

Upon running, the script will prompt you to enter the text data you want to encrypt. The script will then display the encrypted data in both integer and hexadecimal format. Subsequently, it will decrypt the data and display the original text.

### Example

```
Enter data to encrypt: Hello KingBOB
Valid Input!!!
Encrypted data is:  [Encrypted Integer]
Hex value : [Encrypted Hexadecimal]
Data after decryption is : Hello KingBOB
```
